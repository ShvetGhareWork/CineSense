# LinkedIn Post - CineSense Project

---

🎬 **Excited to share my latest project: CineSense!** 🚀

I've just completed building CineSense - a full-stack mobile application that revolutionizes how we discover and track movies and TV shows. This project showcases modern mobile development practices with a focus on user experience and intelligent features.

## 🔥 What is CineSense?

CineSense is an intelligent entertainment tracking platform that helps users:
✅ Discover trending movies and TV shows
✅ Manage personalized watchlists with status tracking
✅ Get AI-powered recommendations using Google Gemini
✅ Track viewing statistics and progress
✅ Access detailed information about cast, crew, and streaming availability

## 💡 Key Technical Highlights

**Frontend (Mobile)**
- React Native 0.73 with Expo for cross-platform development
- Zustand for efficient state management
- Custom UI with beautiful gradients and smooth animations
- Local-first architecture with AsyncStorage persistence
- Optimized API caching for better performance

**Backend (API)**
- Node.js + Express.js RESTful API
- MongoDB Atlas for scalable data storage
- JWT-based authentication with bcrypt security
- Integration with TMDB API for comprehensive media data
- Google Gemini AI for personalized recommendations
- Rate limiting and security best practices

## 🎯 Unique Features

**Local-First Approach**: Users can start using the app immediately without creating an account. Data is stored locally on their device, with optional cloud sync for those who want cross-device access.

**Smart Watchlist**: Track what you want to watch, currently watching, and completed content with progress tracking for TV shows.

**AI Recommendations**: Leveraging Google Gemini to provide context-aware, personalized suggestions based on viewing history and preferences.

**Beautiful UX**: Modern dark theme with smooth animations, intuitive navigation, and responsive design.

## 🔧 Technical Challenges Solved

During development, I tackled several interesting challenges:

1. **Backend Deployment**: Configured Express trust proxy for Render's reverse proxy environment, resolving 401 authentication errors.

2. **Data Architecture**: Designed a flexible data structure that supports both local storage and future cloud sync capabilities.

3. **Performance Optimization**: Implemented intelligent caching strategies to minimize API calls while keeping data fresh.

4. **React Native Compatibility**: Resolved version conflicts between react-native-mmkv and React Native 0.73.

## 📊 Project Stats

- 50+ React Native screens and components
- RESTful API with 15+ endpoints
- Integration with 2 external APIs (TMDB, Gemini)
- Local data persistence with cloud sync capability
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

## 🚀 What's Next?

I'm planning to add:
- Social features (share watchlists, follow friends)
- Advanced filtering and recommendation algorithms
- Push notifications for new releases
- iOS version
- Multi-language support

## 💭 Key Learnings

This project reinforced the importance of:
- User-centric design (local-first approach)
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- Performance optimization in mobile apps
- Security best practices in full-stack development
- Debugging complex data flow issues
